<p><p>A loss of electrical supplies to a large portion of the Sellafield\r\n site was experienced during Monday 9th October 2000. The failure\r\n centred on faults experienced on a new section of 11kV switchgear.\r\n Supplies were re-established within 47 minutes of the loss, well\r\n within the two hours allowed for in the safety case.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The actions of BNFL during the recovery phase from the incident\r\n were found to be generally commendable, ensuring reinstatement of\r\n electrical supplies to the affected area well within the time allowed\r\n in the safety case.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>An NII team carried out an initial investigation into the\r\n incident. It concluded that the direct cause was a defective\r\n component in new electrical switchgear being installed as part of a\r\n project to update the electrical infrastructure on the site. The work\r\n was being carried out by Norweb, as contractors to BNFL, to\r\n arrangements that were regarded as standard practice for this sort of\r\n work.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL also carried out an investigation, which came to similar\r\n conclusions. This report is still formally awaited by NII, although\r\n there has been sufficient progress in satisfying NII&#39;s safety\r\n concerns with respect to the electrical infrastructure at\r\n Sellafield.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International\r\n Nuclear Events Scale (INES). </p></p>
