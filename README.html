<h1>nuclear-ghost</h1>

<p>The repository hopes to amass the quarterly nuclear incidents from The Office for Nuclear Regulation (An agency of the HSE) as machine readable documents.</p>

<p>Currently nuclear incident reports are released as unstructure html documents which are difficult to navigate, understand and analysis in any comprehensive way. </p>

<p>The initial idea of this repository was to write a script to scrape the ONR website and extract the data semi-automatically but the html proofed too unstructured for my pattern detecting skills. So I have opted to manually copy and paste the website into a suitable file format. The ONR are very busy people and don&#39;t have time to do this type of super complex data manipulation themselves - at least according to one recent Freedom of Information <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/foi/2013/2013100405.htm">request</a>. So I thought it best, as a good citizen to take on this heavy burden. </p>

<p>It is of course obvious to to everyone that a multi-billion pound nuclear industrial could never cobble together the huge resources which are needed to compile a comprehensive list safety of incidents in a machine readable format i.e. a spreadsheet. I&#39;m also totally sure their monitoring system includes an a far more sophisticated method for managing safety incidents information - may be telephatically based or using nano bots or an advanced form of post-it notes scattered across a photo-sensitive membrane. Either way and sure it&#39;s way more advanced than the technology joe public uses so that&#39;s probably why they can&#39;t release this sort of info.</p>
