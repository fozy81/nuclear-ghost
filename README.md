=============

The repository hopes to amass the quarterly nuclear incidents reports from The Office for Nuclear Regulation (An agency of the HSE) as machine readable documents.

Currently nuclear incident reports are released as unstructure html documents which are difficult to navigate, understand and analysis in any comprehensive way. 

The initial idea of this repository was to write a script to scrape the ONR website and extract the data semi-automatically but the html proved too unstructured for my pattern detecting skills. So I have opted to manually copy and paste the website into a suitable file format. The ONR are very busy people and don't have time to do this type of super complex data manipulation themselves - at least according to one recent Freedom of Information [request](http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/foi/2013/2013100405.htm). So I thought I'd help out.
