=============

The repository hopes to amass the quarterly nuclear incidents reports from The Office for Nuclear Regulation (An agency of the HSE) as machine readable documents.

Currently nuclear incident reports are released as unstructure html documents which are difficult to navigate, understand and analysis in any comprehensive way. 

The initial idea of this repository was to write a script to scrape the ONR website and extract the data semi-automatically but the html proofed too unstructured for my pattern detecting skills. So I have opted to manually copy and paste the website into a suitable file format. The ONR are very busy people and don't have time to do this type of super complex data manipulation themselves - at least according to one recent Freedom of Information [request](http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/foi/2013/2013100405.htm). So I thought it best, as a good citizen to take on this heavy burden. 

It is of course obvious to to everyone that a multi-billion pound nuclear industrial could never cobble together the huge resources which are needed to compile a comprehensive list of safety incidents in a machine readable format i.e. a spreadsheet. I'm also totally sure their monitoring system includes an a far more sophisticated method for managing safety incidents information - may be telephatically based or using nano bots or an advanced form of post-it notes scattered across a photo-sensitive membrane. Either way, I'm sure it's way more advanced than the technology joe public uses so that's probably why they can't release this sort of info.
