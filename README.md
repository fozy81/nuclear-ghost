This repository contains the quarterly nuclear incidents reports from The Office for Nuclear Regulation (An agency of the HSE) as machine readable documents.

Currently nuclear incident reports are released as unstructure html documents which are difficult to navigate, understand and analyse.

The initial idea of this repository was to write a script to scrape the ONR website and extract the data automatically but the html proved too unstructured to scrape. So I have opted to manually copy and paste the website into a suitable file format. The ONR are very busy people and don't have time to do this type of super complex data manipulation themselves - at least according to one recent Freedom of Information [request](http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/foi/2013/2013100405.htm). So I thought I'd help out :-P

During the process a couple of interesting points came to light. Firstly, the incidents were not all rated using the International Nuclear Events Scale. It is a little unclear if these events don't reach that level or are awaiting categorisation. Also some incidents appear to have a level '0' rating which is not on the 1-7 scale. Again, it's a little hard to understand what this signifys. Secondly, there not all incidents have exact dates or times. This is understandable in some instances but more precise details would be useful. The only incident with a stated time was 01:40 - perhaps night working poses more risks - we will never know without the data.
