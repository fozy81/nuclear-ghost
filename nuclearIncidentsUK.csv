SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,08/10/00,Q4 00,2000,1," <p>A loss of electrical supplies to a large portion of the Sellafield\r\n site was experienced during Monday 9th October 2000. The failure\r\n centred on faults experienced on a new section of 11kV switchgear.\r\n Supplies were re-established within 47 minutes of the loss, well\r\n within the two hours allowed for in the safety case.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The actions of BNFL during the recovery phase from the incident\r\n were found to be generally commendable, ensuring reinstatement of\r\n electrical supplies to the affected area well within the time allowed\r\n in the safety case.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>An NII team carried out an initial investigation into the\r\n incident. It concluded that the direct cause was a defective\r\n component in new electrical switchgear being installed as part of a\r\n project to update the electrical infrastructure on the site. The work\r\n was being carried out by Norweb, as contractors to BNFL, to\r\n arrangements that were regarded as standard practice for this sort of\r\n work.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL also carried out an investigation, which came to similar\r\n conclusions. This report is still formally awaited by NII, although\r\n there has been sufficient progress in satisfying NII&#39;s safety\r\n concerns with respect to the electrical infrastructure at\r\n Sellafield.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International\r\n Nuclear Events Scale (INES). </p>",54.4193,-3.4874
HUNTERSTON B (British Energy Generation (UK) plc),,N/A,Q1 01,2001,1,"<p>During routine monitoring of Hunterston B, it was discovered that\r\n there was radioactivity in the ground water in the bore holes\r\n associated with reactor 4. This event was reported under the site\r\n arrangements, initially to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate\r\n (NII) and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), and later to\r\n other government departments.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The licensee continues to investigate this matter with the\r\n assistance of company specialists and external contractors. The\r\n findings so far suggest that the levels of radioactivity present in\r\n the ground water are low and are decreasing. The source of the\r\n activity has not yet been conclusively identified, and this continues\r\n to be investigated by the licensee. Indications are that it was a\r\n one-off rather than continuous or recurring event.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>So far there are no detectable off-site effects, and steps are\r\n being taken to remove the arisings as they build up in the bore\r\n holes. Currently the evidence suggests that this event is not of\r\n radiological significance for workers and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International\r\n Nuclear Event Scale (INES). The NII and SEPA are being kept informed\r\n of developments in this matter.</p>",55.72269,-4.88997
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,06/03/01,Q1 01,2001,1,"<p>On 6 March 2001, during a routine glove change operation on a\r\n glovebox in the plutonium processing section of the B205 Magnox\r\n reprocessing plant at Sellafield, plutonium contamination was\r\n released into the working area.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>This occurred when a seal weld on a waste export bag failed,\r\n releasing contaminated waste items onto the floor. Two workers were\r\n exposed to elevated levels of airborne plutonium, and BNFL&#39;s\r\n early estimate is that they have each received an effective internal\r\n exposure of about 4 mSv.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL&#39;s best estimate of the amount of radioactive material\r\n spilled is 24 Mbq of plutonium-239 and 720 Mbq of plutonium-241. This\r\n is 24 times the reporting level specified in IRR99 for plutonium-239\r\n and seven times that specified for plutonium-241. BNFL has recovered\r\n the spilled material and decontaminated the working area. There was\r\n no release of radioactivity to the environment following the event or\r\n during the clean up activities.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>HSE investigated the event and required BNFL to undertake a site\r\n wide review of similar operations. This confirmed that there was a\r\n wide variation in the methods used for work within plutonium\r\n gloveboxes on the site. BNFL has developed an action plan to prevent\r\n a recurrence in B205. In addition, BNFL is reviewing its methods for\r\n carrying out plutonium glovebox operations.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>HSE is considering taking formal regulatory action. The incident\r\n was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale\r\n (INES).</p>",54.4193,-3.4874
CHAPELCROSS (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,N/A,Q1 01,2001,1,"<p>During refuelling operations on Reactor 2, an irradiated fuel\r\n element failed to release from the grab (this is used to hold an\r\n element while it is withdrawn from a reactor). Routine methods were\r\n used to release the grab. However, the irradiated fuel element\r\n snagged during the operation and was lifted out of its shielding\r\n resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the\r\n intense radiation being emitted from the irradiated fuel element.\r\n Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose received by\r\n them was small.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The event revealed shortfalls in the safety of the refuelling\r\n operation and the licensee took the immediate step of halting all\r\n refuelling operations while it investigated the event and reviewed\r\n the safety of the equipment. The NII investigated the event and\r\n judged that it was due to inadequate design and operation of the\r\n equipment. The licensee has modified the equipment and procedures in\r\n accordance with the nuclear site licence requirements and NII has\r\n agreed to fuelling operations continuing.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International\r\n Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br />\r\n </p>",55.0176,-3.224
HEYSHAM 1 (British Energy Generation Limited),,N/A,Q3 01,2001,1,"<p>To meet the requirements of the nuclear site licence, each of the\r\n two reactors at Heysham 1 is shutdown periodically to enable\r\n examination, inspection, maintenance or testing of safety related\r\n components that cannot be accessed when the reactor is operating.\r\n Reactor 1 was subject to a periodic shutdown in August/September\r\n 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Inspections of the reactor graphite core are carried out using\r\n remote TV cameras and equipment to measure the geometry of the core\r\n components. The aim of the inspections is to confirm that the core\r\n components are performing in accordance with the predictions assumed\r\n in the safety case. During the planned inspections of the Reactor 1\r\n core fuel channels, BEGL found cracks in some of the graphite bricks.\r\n The cracking of reactor core bricks is a known and predicted ageing\r\n condition for irradiated graphite and has been observed at other AGR\r\n stations. BEGL responded to the inspection findings in a conservative\r\n way by revisiting and updating their existing core safety case for\r\n Heysham 1. Consideration was also given to the possible implications\r\n of the inspection findings to the other operating AGRs . The BEGL\r\n review considered the inspection results against the assumptions made\r\n in the existing safety case, which included the possibility of cracks\r\n in the core bricks, and concluded that the revised core safety case\r\n was valid for a further period of operation.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Specialist graphite inspectors from the HSE&#39;s Nuclear\r\n Installations Inspectorate carried out a detailed assessment of the\r\n revised core safety case, to ensure that the required safety\r\n functionality of the reactor core would be maintained for a further\r\n period of operation. NII&#39;s assessment focussed on ensuring\r\n sufficient safety margins were available in the safety case to allow\r\n for any further cracking of the core bricks. The NII assessment\r\n concluded that the safety case was adequate to support the return to\r\n service of Heysham 1 Reactor 1 and that the safety cases for other\r\n AGR stations remained valid.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The event was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear\r\n Events Scale (INES).</p>",54.02924,-2.91493
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,06/07/01,Q3 01,2001,1,"<p>During a rainstorm on 6 July 2001, localised flooding about 10-15\r\n centimetres deep occurred outside a laboratory complex and overflowed\r\n an external door threshold into the building. The water entered an\r\n old laboratory which is currently being decommissioned. Historic\r\n plutonium (Pu) contamination, probably from under a floor lining, was\r\n re-suspended by the flooding and spread over part of the laboratory\r\n floor. The area has subsequently been cleaned up and decontaminated.\r\n There was no release of radioactivity from the building and no\r\n radiation dose received by the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL reported the incident as a spill under the Ionising\r\n Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRR99). The estimated amount of activity\r\n involved was equivalent to 10MBq of 239Pu and 200MBq of 241Pu which\r\n is respectively 10 and two times the IRR reporting level. The\r\n incident was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event\r\n Scale (INES).</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL carried out remedial work on the building to prevent a\r\n reoccurrence of the water ingress, and additional work is in hand to\r\n strengthen these measures.

SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,N/A,Q4 01,2001,0,"<p>British Nuclear Fuels reported the detection of Tc<sup>99</sup> in\r\n groundwater taken from a borehole on its Sellafield site close to the\r\n Main Gate. This was the result for the first analysis of groundwater\r\n from this borehole for this isotope. The incident report noted that\r\n the sample may have been a false analysis. Subsequent analyses have\r\n confirmed Tc<sup>99</sup> in this borehole and, at lesser\r\n concentration, in others in the same area. Activity has also been\r\n detected beyond the site boundary but at much lower\r\n concentrations.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The Health and Safety Executive&#39;s Nuclear Installations\r\n Inspectorate (NII) has asked BNFL to determine the source of the\r\n activity and to report the work the company is undertaking to prevent\r\n further leakage from the plant and to prevent activity leaving the\r\n site.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The company has confirmed that the probable source of activity in\r\n the ground is the sludge storage tanks in Building B241. These old\r\n tanks have been suspected to be leaking for some years and recent\r\n modifications have been made to address this. The recent detection\r\n appears to be confirmation that leaked material has reached the\r\n groundwater on the site. The fall off of activity concentration in\r\n boreholes away from the plant is consistent with B241 being the\r\n source of the activity.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>To remove the potential for leakage from this old facility, BNFL\r\n is proposing to commence emptying the storage tanks in 2002. The NII\r\n is currently considering the safety case for BNFL&#39;s plans to do\r\n this.

It also has requested BNFL to undertake\r\n monitoring to confirm the point of leakage, and will work with NII to\r\n consider any regulatory action.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident has been classified as Level 0 on the International\r\n Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br />\r\n </p>",54.4193,-3.4874
Dungeness B - British Energy Generation Limited (BEGL),,January,Q1 02,2002,N/A,"<p>In January 2002 BEGL reported two events that had each led to\r\n water leaks from joints in large diameter pipes of the Dungeness B\r\n Water Spray Fire System. In both cases, the system was removed from\r\n service to enable the leaks to be repaired. As the Water Spray Fire\r\n System protects safety-related equipment from fire, the reactors were\r\n shut down to maintain nuclear safety. The Nuclear Installations\r\n Inspectorate (NII) Site Inspector&#39;s initial investigation raised\r\n a number of concerns with respect to the adequacy of the Water Spray\r\n Fire System. A Direction to review and reassess safety was issued\r\n under Licence Condition 15(4). The results of this were reported to\r\n NII by the end of March 2002 as required.

HEYSHAM 1 - British Energy Generation Limited (BEGL),,11/03/02,Q1 02,2002,2,"<p>British Energy reported an event at Heysham 1 on 11 March\r\n involving a fuelling machine operation at a Fuel Storage Tube. The\r\n machine had collected a new fuel assembly from the tube and had\r\n replaced this with a short shield plug. Unknown to the operators, and\r\n contrary to the indications at the fuelling machine, the shield plug\r\n had not disconnected from the machine grab. A mechanical interlock\r\n designed to prevent the machine moving until safe to do so had\r\n failed. This allowed the machine to move sideways which resulted in\r\n impact between the shield plug and the storage tube. The shield plug\r\n was severed into two parts with the lower part falling into the\r\n storage tube.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The NII Site Inspector visited the site within a few hours of the\r\n event being reported. He confirmed that the nuclear safety\r\n significance of the actual event was low, but that it could have been\r\n more serious if the fuelling machine had been operating at the\r\n reactor. There are, however, other interlocks to provide protection\r\n in this case. He also confirmed that a full investigation was\r\n underway and that the refuelling safety case would be revalidated\r\n before the machine was used again over the reactor.

Torness - British Energy (BE),,N/A,Q3 02,2002,N/A,"<p>The sudden and extensive failure of a gas circulator at Torness in\r\n May 2002 was thought, from forensic evidence, to be linked to the\r\n development of an unexpected fatigue related crack in part of the\r\n impeller. In August, another gas circulator on the other Torness\r\n reactor showed signs of increasing vibration and was promptly shut\r\n down by the operators. Its subsequent disassembly revealed a fully\r\n developed fatigue related crack in a similar position to the first\r\n failure, but the prompt shutdown had prevented consequential\r\n damage.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Following the initial failure, British Energy (BE) increased the\r\n attention given to circulator vibration monitoring. As a result of\r\n the second failure, more extensive routine monitoring of circulator\r\n characteristics is being undertaken and more extensive circulator\r\n monitoring equipment is being fitted to allow efficient, cross-fleet\r\n monitoring of circulator behaviour. Activities in this area are being\r\n brought up to best practice standards.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Inspectors from HSE&#39;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII)\r\n monitored the recovery of the first failed circulator and its\r\n examination by BE specialists, and BE&#39;s examination of the fixed\r\n structure for any signs of damage. Agreement to replace the failed\r\n generator was given by HSE when it was satisfied that there was no\r\n structural damage to the reactor. As the second failure did not\r\n result in the disintegration of the circulator impeller there was no\r\n damage to the reactor structure.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>With the discovery of a systematic and comparatively frequent\r\n failure mechanism, safety concerns increased and NII required a\r\n revised and extended safety case to cover operations. This\r\n incorporated forewarning of failure by early and effective detection\r\n of changes in vibration patterns together with recognition of the\r\n need to shut down any affected circulators before major failure and\r\n consequential challenge to the circulator casing occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BE has inspected all gas circulator impellers in service at\r\n Torness and found no evidence of developing defects. Only a limited\r\n number of impellers have been inspected at Heysham 2, but again no\r\n defects have been found. BE has provided acceptable interim safety\r\n cases justifying continued operation of the reactors at Torness and\r\n at its sister station Heysham 2, and will produce, in the spring of\r\n 2003, final safety cases incorporating all the findings from its\r\n inquiry into the failures and changes introduced in the light of the\r\n events at Torness.</p>",55.96825,-2.40659

Sellafield (British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited),,13/02/05,Q1 05,2005,N/A,"<p> On 13 February 2005, three staff were contaminated whilst changing a thermocouple on Thorp Head End Dissolver vessel C. The risk assessment for the work did not anticipate a breach of containment, as the design intent was for the thermocouple separated from the dissolved nuclear fuel by being located inside a sealed tube called a 'thermowell'. This intent was not achieved. After initial incident, whilst seeking reassurance monitoring, the workers spread contamination to various plant areas and were then taken to site surgery for decontamination. The workers were contaminated on the face and hands and decontamination of the hands continued over several days. BNGSL have advised NII that no statutory dose limits were exceeded, although one worker received an extremity dose greater than 10% of the annual statutory limit. </p>\r\n <p> On the day of the event, the Thorp Incident Control Centre was set up and plant access restricted until decontamination was complete. Investigations indicated that there was a slight leak in the Dissolver C thermowell, which appears to have allowed contamination in-seepage.

Sellafield (British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited),,01/04/05,Q2 05,2005,3,"<p>  On the 20 th April 2005 British Nuclear Group Sellafield Ltd, (BNGSL), the licensee, discovered a leak which had occurred within the Thorp Head End Feed Clarification Cell. The leak was from pipe-work to a vessel designated an Accountancy Tank that held dissolved fuel in nitric acid solution while accountancy calculations were made. The leak was estimated at 83 cubic metres. HSE/NII was informed of the leak later the same day. </p>\r\n <p> The relevant plant and operations including fuel shearing were promptly shut down by BNGSL. Some down-stream parts of the plant were subsequently restarted, after discussion with NII, in order to drain other tanks in the same cell which had liquor held within them when the plant was shut down. </p>\r\n <p> The leak was into a stainless steel clad, heavily shielded cell designed to contain such leaks, and there has been no indication that any liquid leaked from the cell. Plant radiation monitoring showed that there was neither abnormal radioactivity in air nor radioactivity released to the environment as a result of this event. BNGSL has concluded that no workers or members of the public have been affected. </p>\r\n <p> Camera inspections within the cell showed that other pipe work and vessels within the cell showed no sign of leakage. BNGSL criticality assessors concluded that a criticality was not possible based on the properties of the leaked liquor. </p>\r\n <p> On notification of the event, NII set up an internal review group to consider the adequacy of the actions taken to recover the situation. NII was kept fully informed of recovery plans and monitored the situation closely to ensure that safety remained assured. The cell has built-in equipment for the recovery of any leaked liquor back into primary containment tanks and all the leaked liquid has now been recovered this way. NII is satisfied that the plant remains in a safe state and that there have been no harmful effects to people or the environment. Liaison was maintained throughout with the Environment Agency. </p>\r\n <p> BNGSL evaluated this event as INES category 3, because of the significant release of radioactivity into the secondary containment. </p>\r\n <p> Subsequent to the completion of the â\u0080\u0098make safeâ\u0080\u0099 operations, an NII team commenced an investigation at the site on 16 th May 2005. The preliminary findings led NII to issue two Improvement Notices on 17 th June 2005 to ensure that BNGSL promptly rectified deficiencies in compliance with nuclear site licence conditions relating to the operation of the THORP Feed Clarification Cell. The Improvement Notices compel BNGSL to improve compliance in the areas of leak detection, operating instructions, record keeping and maintenance and testing of safety related equipment. The NII investigation is continuing, but it is too soon to say whether this will result in further regulatory action. </p>\r\n <p> In the meantime, BNGSL is considering options for the restart of the plant and has liaised with regulators on its initial ideas, but a firm proposal has not yet been submitted. </p>",54.4193,-3.4874
Sellafield (British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited),,04/12/05,Q4 05,2005,N/A,"<p> On 4 December 2005, British Nuclear Group Sellafield Ltd, (BNGSL), the licensee, detected high levels of radiation in some outcell areas of the Highly Active Liquor Evaporation and Storage (HALES) facility. This occurred during a routine operation to sample highly active liquor. </p>\r\n <p> The operation was stopped. Operators evacuated the building safely and quickly in accordance with instructions. Controlled reâ\u0080\u0091entries into the building were then carried out to define the scope of the problem and put in place appropriate contingency controls and recovery plans. </p>\r\n <p> There was no loss of primary containment and no environmental effects were found inside or external to the building. Restrictions were placed on the use of an adjacent building because of high background radiation levels but were later removed on successful completion of the recovery plans. </p>\r\n <p> Three operators carried out the sampling operation. They received radiation doses, which were elevated though well within legal limits. </p>\r\n <p> The source of the high radiation was traced to a small diameter wash line feeding the sampling plant. The line has since been cleared, restoring normal operating conditions except to local areas where some access restrictions remain. </p>\r\n <p> HSEâ\u0080\u0099s NII has conducted a preliminary investigation and BNGSL is conducting its own internal investigation. The root cause of the incident has not yet been established but on the basis of its own investigation, BNGSL has already recognised the need to improve its approach to learning from experience in HALES. NII will await completion of BNGSL's investigation before deciding whether enforcement action is warranted. </p>\r\n <p> NIl will seek engineered improvements to ensure the safety of future sampling operations. </p>",54.4193,-3.4874

Sellafield ,,N/A,Q4 06,2006,N/A,"<p>A formal investigation has been undertaken by NII into the incident involving a major injury accident (a broken arm, fractured ulna and crush injuries to the wrist) to one of BNGSL workers whilst maintaining equipment in the Waste Treatment Complex Supercompactor Glovebox Suite on the Sellafield Licensed Site. </p>\r\n    <p>The results of the investigation have given rise to concerns regarding BNGSLâ\u0080\u0099s arrangements for compliance with The Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRRâ\u0080\u0099s) and The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER).</p>\r\n    <p>Both the NII investigation and BNGSLâ\u0080\u0099s own Board of Inquiry have identified that several issues have arisen regarding the efficient working of the Supercompactor equipment. </p>\r\n    <p>These issues combined to promote degraded conditions and unreliability of the equipment and the requirement for frequent manual interventions. This resulted in the persons working on the plant being exposed to unacceptable risk from the serious and significant committed dose potential of a glove/skin puncture wound, as well as physical major injury. </p>\r\n    <p>NII investigation has shown that the unreliability stemmed from the equipment being used under conditions outside of its original design intent and not being maintained in efficient working order and in good repair.</p>\r\n    <p>BNGSL have responded cooperatively and proactively to both the Board of Inquiry report and the NII investigation and this has informed NII thinking with respect to the requirement for formal enforcement action. </p>\r\n    <p>An Improvement Notice is to be issued to enforce the necessary improvements required to make working on the Supercompactor Glovebox suite safe. </p>",54.4193,-3.4874
Dounreay,,20/05/07,Q2 07,2007,N/A,"<p>On 20th May 2007 UKAEA personnel performed a radiological survey of the inside of a  manhole that services an inactive drain line on the North West side of the Dounreay site. This is a part of the site where historic contamination is known to be  present. A contamination smear sample  from inside the manhole showed the presence of about 1.3kBq of alpha emitting radioactive material which was subsequently found to contain 60% plutonium/americium. The manhole was  sealed and the area designated as â\u0080\u0098radioactive contamination highâ\u0080\u0099. The quantity of plutonium on the smear sample was about 1000 times less than that of Column 4 of Schedule 8 of Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999.</p>\r\n    <p>As part of their investigation UKAEA placed a temporary enclosure over the manhole to provide an additional means of containing any plutonium present and to facilitate control over personnel entries to perform further radiological surveys. Surveys of the inside of the manhole were performed on 3rd July 2007, through the temporary enclosure by UKAEA  personnel wearing air fed suits. No further alpha contamination was found inside the manhole. UKAEAâ\u0080\u0098s investigation is still ongoing, but  is expected to conclude that there is no significant contamination inside the manhole, however the source of the plutonium contamination from the smear sample remains unknown.</p>\r\n    <p>The alpha contamination found on 20th June 2007 on a filter processing water  from a spring just outside the site boundary, but close to the contaminated manhole was investigated in depth. The investigation indicated that the initial result was spurious.</p>",,
Sellafield,,19/09/08,Q3 08,2008,N/A,"<p>On 19 September  2008 a fault occurred on the radioactive Waste Vitrification Plant (WVP) Line 3  shield door interlock system. Nobody was injured or received any radiation  dose.Â  </p>\r\n <p>During a planned  changeover of hydraulic supply units in Line 3, an uncontrolled movement of two  shielded trap doors and other hydraulic-drive components was observed. These  components protect against the inadvertent exposure of workers to radiation and  so are designated Safety Mechanisms.Â  </p>\r\n <p>One movement was  of the trap door between the Line 3 Control Cell and Decontamination Cell. Neither  cell was occupied at the time, though personnel access to these cells is  permitted and it is possible for personnel to be working in one cell while a  container of vitrified waste is present in the other. The radiation dose rate  from a container of vitrified waste is very high and hence the incident had the  potential to cause a significant radiation dose.Â  </p>\r\n <p>The root cause of  the incident has not yet been established and is the subject of ongoing work by  Sellafield Limited. Meanwhile Sellafield Limited has suspended all of Line 3  shield door operations.</p>",54.4193,-3.4874
Sellafield Limited,,01/04/09,Q2 09,2009,N/A,"<p>   On  1 April 2009, cooling water flow was lost to the Highly Active Liquor  Evaporation and Storage (HALES) plant. A  quantity of this water was discharged to ground because of a pre-existing  rupture to an underground pipeline. No  one was injured as a result of the incident and the cooling water was not  radioactive.</p>\r\n <p>   HSE  launched two separate but linked investigations to consider the reasons why  cooling water flow was lost and the pipeline was ruptured. We have concluded that the immediate cause of  the former aspect was the inadvertent opening of a valve during the plant  reinstatement following the completion of engineering work, and of the latter  that a borehole had been drilled through the underground pipeline in March  2009.</p>\r\n <p>   Sellafield  Limited responded to the incident in an appropriate manner. The valve in question was closed and cooling  water was restored promptly.<br />\r\n   The  incident was significant to nuclear safety because of the reliance that the  HALES plant places on cooling water supply.  The plant stores a significant quantity of highly active liquor (HAL)  which can self heat to boiling temperature.  Redundant and diverse cooling water supplies are consequently engineered  to prevent boiling; ensuring the temperature of the HAL is kept within  acceptable limits to prevent an off site release of radioactivity.<br />\r\n   HSE  is continuing its investigations to fully understand the underlying reasons for  the incident and is considering appropriate enforcement options.</p>",54.4193,-3.4874
Dungeness B,,N/A,Q2 09,2009,N/A,"<p>   Following  a failed attempt to connect new fuel at Dungeness B Nuclear Power Station, a  new fuel assembly was left suspended ten foot off the ground within the new  fuel transfer route. As part of the recovery, building foam was injected in the  tube below the fuel assembly to prevent the assembly dropping. Subsequent  analysis showed that the foam could act as a moderator and may have challenged  the margin to criticality. The foam escaped from the tube and landed on the  floor of the fuel cell. A mechanical restraint was applied to prevent the fuel  assembly from moving, and work subsequently done to safety delatch and recover  the assembly.</p>",50.91333,0.95985
