SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,08/10/00,Q4 00,2000,1," <p>A loss of electrical supplies to a large portion of the Sellafield\r\n site was experienced during Monday 9th October 2000. The failure\r\n centred on faults experienced on a new section of 11kV switchgear.\r\n Supplies were re-established within 47 minutes of the loss, well\r\n within the two hours allowed for in the safety case.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The actions of BNFL during the recovery phase from the incident\r\n were found to be generally commendable, ensuring reinstatement of\r\n electrical supplies to the affected area well within the time allowed\r\n in the safety case.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>An NII team carried out an initial investigation into the\r\n incident. It concluded that the direct cause was a defective\r\n component in new electrical switchgear being installed as part of a\r\n project to update the electrical infrastructure on the site. The work\r\n was being carried out by Norweb, as contractors to BNFL, to\r\n arrangements that were regarded as standard practice for this sort of\r\n work.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL also carried out an investigation, which came to similar\r\n conclusions. This report is still formally awaited by NII, although\r\n there has been sufficient progress in satisfying NII&#39;s safety\r\n concerns with respect to the electrical infrastructure at\r\n Sellafield.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International\r\n Nuclear Events Scale (INES). </p>",54.4193,-3.4874
HUNTERSTON B (British Energy Generation (UK) plc),,N/A,Q1 01,2001,1,"<p>During routine monitoring of Hunterston B, it was discovered that\r\n there was radioactivity in the ground water in the bore holes\r\n associated with reactor 4. This event was reported under the site\r\n arrangements, initially to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate\r\n (NII) and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), and later to\r\n other government departments.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The licensee continues to investigate this matter with the\r\n assistance of company specialists and external contractors. The\r\n findings so far suggest that the levels of radioactivity present in\r\n the ground water are low and are decreasing. The source of the\r\n activity has not yet been conclusively identified, and this continues\r\n to be investigated by the licensee. Indications are that it was a\r\n one-off rather than continuous or recurring event.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>So far there are no detectable off-site effects, and steps are\r\n being taken to remove the arisings as they build up in the bore\r\n holes. Currently the evidence suggests that this event is not of\r\n radiological significance for workers and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International\r\n Nuclear Event Scale (INES). The NII and SEPA are being kept informed\r\n of developments in this matter.</p>",55.72269,-4.88997
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,06/03/01,Q1 01,2001,1,"<p>On 6 March 2001, during a routine glove change operation on a\r\n glovebox in the plutonium processing section of the B205 Magnox\r\n reprocessing plant at Sellafield, plutonium contamination was\r\n released into the working area.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>This occurred when a seal weld on a waste export bag failed,\r\n releasing contaminated waste items onto the floor. Two workers were\r\n exposed to elevated levels of airborne plutonium, and BNFL&#39;s\r\n early estimate is that they have each received an effective internal\r\n exposure of about 4 mSv.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL&#39;s best estimate of the amount of radioactive material\r\n spilled is 24 Mbq of plutonium-239 and 720 Mbq of plutonium-241. This\r\n is 24 times the reporting level specified in IRR99 for plutonium-239\r\n and seven times that specified for plutonium-241. BNFL has recovered\r\n the spilled material and decontaminated the working area. There was\r\n no release of radioactivity to the environment following the event or\r\n during the clean up activities.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>HSE investigated the event and required BNFL to undertake a site\r\n wide review of similar operations. This confirmed that there was a\r\n wide variation in the methods used for work within plutonium\r\n gloveboxes on the site. BNFL has developed an action plan to prevent\r\n a recurrence in B205. In addition, BNFL is reviewing its methods for\r\n carrying out plutonium glovebox operations.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>HSE is considering taking formal regulatory action. The incident\r\n was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale\r\n (INES).</p>",54.4193,-3.4874
CHAPELCROSS (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,N/A,Q1 01,2001,1,"<p>During refuelling operations on Reactor 2, an irradiated fuel\r\n element failed to release from the grab (this is used to hold an\r\n element while it is withdrawn from a reactor). Routine methods were\r\n used to release the grab. However, the irradiated fuel element\r\n snagged during the operation and was lifted out of its shielding\r\n resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the\r\n intense radiation being emitted from the irradiated fuel element.\r\n Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose received by\r\n them was small.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The event revealed shortfalls in the safety of the refuelling\r\n operation and the licensee took the immediate step of halting all\r\n refuelling operations while it investigated the event and reviewed\r\n the safety of the equipment. The NII investigated the event and\r\n judged that it was due to inadequate design and operation of the\r\n equipment. The licensee has modified the equipment and procedures in\r\n accordance with the nuclear site licence requirements and NII has\r\n agreed to fuelling operations continuing.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International\r\n Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br />\r\n </p>",55.0176,-3.224
HEYSHAM 1 (British Energy Generation Limited),,N/A,Q3 01,2001,1,"<p>To meet the requirements of the nuclear site licence, each of the\r\n two reactors at Heysham 1 is shutdown periodically to enable\r\n examination, inspection, maintenance or testing of safety related\r\n components that cannot be accessed when the reactor is operating.\r\n Reactor 1 was subject to a periodic shutdown in August/September\r\n 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Inspections of the reactor graphite core are carried out using\r\n remote TV cameras and equipment to measure the geometry of the core\r\n components. The aim of the inspections is to confirm that the core\r\n components are performing in accordance with the predictions assumed\r\n in the safety case. During the planned inspections of the Reactor 1\r\n core fuel channels, BEGL found cracks in some of the graphite bricks.\r\n The cracking of reactor core bricks is a known and predicted ageing\r\n condition for irradiated graphite and has been observed at other AGR\r\n stations. BEGL responded to the inspection findings in a conservative\r\n way by revisiting and updating their existing core safety case for\r\n Heysham 1. Consideration was also given to the possible implications\r\n of the inspection findings to the other operating AGRs . The BEGL\r\n review considered the inspection results against the assumptions made\r\n in the existing safety case, which included the possibility of cracks\r\n in the core bricks, and concluded that the revised core safety case\r\n was valid for a further period of operation.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Specialist graphite inspectors from the HSE&#39;s Nuclear\r\n Installations Inspectorate carried out a detailed assessment of the\r\n revised core safety case, to ensure that the required safety\r\n functionality of the reactor core would be maintained for a further\r\n period of operation. NII&#39;s assessment focussed on ensuring\r\n sufficient safety margins were available in the safety case to allow\r\n for any further cracking of the core bricks. The NII assessment\r\n concluded that the safety case was adequate to support the return to\r\n service of Heysham 1 Reactor 1 and that the safety cases for other\r\n AGR stations remained valid.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The event was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear\r\n Events Scale (INES).</p>",54.02924,-2.91493
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,06/07/01,Q3 01,2001,1,"<p>During a rainstorm on 6 July 2001, localised flooding about 10-15\r\n centimetres deep occurred outside a laboratory complex and overflowed\r\n an external door threshold into the building. The water entered an\r\n old laboratory which is currently being decommissioned. Historic\r\n plutonium (Pu) contamination, probably from under a floor lining, was\r\n re-suspended by the flooding and spread over part of the laboratory\r\n floor. The area has subsequently been cleaned up and decontaminated.\r\n There was no release of radioactivity from the building and no\r\n radiation dose received by the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL reported the incident as a spill under the Ionising\r\n Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRR99). The estimated amount of activity\r\n involved was equivalent to 10MBq of 239Pu and 200MBq of 241Pu which\r\n is respectively 10 and two times the IRR reporting level. The\r\n incident was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event\r\n Scale (INES).</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL carried out remedial work on the building to prevent a\r\n reoccurrence of the water ingress, and additional work is in hand to\r\n strengthen these measures.

CHAPELCROSS (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,05/07/01 01:20,Q3 01,2001,1,"<p>At 1.20 am on 5 July, during routine discharge operations on\r\n Reactor 3 at BNFL&#39;s Chapelcross nuclear power station, a basket\r\n containing 24 irradiated magnox fuel elements dropped. It fell about\r\n 5 feet onto a door in the pile cap floor, but was still contained\r\n within the discharge machine. BNFL stood down its Emergency Control\r\n Centre at about 6pm when it concluded that the fuel was stable and\r\n that no radioactivity had been released.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>On the eveni<!-- #BeginDate format:IS1 -->2011-10-26<!-- #EndDate -->\r\n detailed remote TV examination, and found that 12 fuel elements were\r\n missing from the basket. After further checks, BNFL concluded that\r\n the door the basket had been resting upon must have been opened\r\n during discharge operations, and that the missing elements must have\r\n fallen about 80 feet, down the discharge shaft through which the\r\n elements are normally lowered in the baskets.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL declared a site incident on 12 July in order to be better\r\n able to co-ordinate its activities. The NII set up its Response\r\n Centre and dispatched a team of inspectors to the site. NII focused\r\n upon ensuring that BNFL took appropriate steps to locate and recover\r\n the missing fuel. They recovered it safely on 17 July, and the NII\r\n was able to stand down its Response Centre as it was satisfied that\r\n no member of the public or employees had incurred any harm from the\r\n incident.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Subsequently, priority was given to regulating BNFL&#39;s recovery\r\n of the 12 irradiated fuel elements still within the discharge\r\n machine. This was achieved safely on 27 October.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BNFL has embargoed routine refuelling operations at Chapelcross,\r\n and will have to provide a safety case to satisfy the NII that it can\r\n return to routine refuelling safely. Similar measures have been taken\r\n at its sister station at Calder Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The NII is producing a report, which will be available to the\r\n public on this incident which was classified as Level 1 on the\r\n International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br />\r\n </p>",55.0176,-3.224
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),,N/A,Q4 01,2001,0,"<p>British Nuclear Fuels reported the detection of Tc<sup>99</sup> in\r\n groundwater taken from a borehole on its Sellafield site close to the\r\n Main Gate. This was the result for the first analysis of groundwater\r\n from this borehole for this isotope. The incident report noted that\r\n the sample may have been a false analysis. Subsequent analyses have\r\n confirmed Tc<sup>99</sup> in this borehole and, at lesser\r\n concentration, in others in the same area. Activity has also been\r\n detected beyond the site boundary but at much lower\r\n concentrations.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The Health and Safety Executive&#39;s Nuclear Installations\r\n Inspectorate (NII) has asked BNFL to determine the source of the\r\n activity and to report the work the company is undertaking to prevent\r\n further leakage from the plant and to prevent activity leaving the\r\n site.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The company has confirmed that the probable source of activity in\r\n the ground is the sludge storage tanks in Building B241. These old\r\n tanks have been suspected to be leaking for some years and recent\r\n modifications have been made to address this. The recent detection\r\n appears to be confirmation that leaked material has reached the\r\n groundwater on the site. The fall off of activity concentration in\r\n boreholes away from the plant is consistent with B241 being the\r\n source of the activity.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>To remove the potential for leakage from this old facility, BNFL\r\n is proposing to commence emptying the storage tanks in 2002. The NII\r\n is currently considering the safety case for BNFL&#39;s plans to do\r\n this. The Inspectorate has requested BNFL&#39;s proposals for control\r\n of the radioactive material that has entered the ground and expects\r\n to receive this soon.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In respect of the activity detected off the site, the Environment\r\n Agency has stated that it is satisfied that the reported\r\n concentration of Tc<sup>99</sup> is radiologically insignificant.\r\n However, until the source of the activity is known, the Agency has\r\n regulatory concern. It also has requested BNFL to undertake\r\n monitoring to confirm the point of leakage, and will work with NII to\r\n consider any regulatory action.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The incident has been classified as Level 0 on the International\r\n Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br />\r\n </p>",54.4193,-3.4874
Dungeness B - British Energy Generation Limited (BEGL),,January,Q1 02,2002,N/A,"<p>In January 2002 BEGL reported two events that had each led to\r\n water leaks from joints in large diameter pipes of the Dungeness B\r\n Water Spray Fire System. In both cases, the system was removed from\r\n service to enable the leaks to be repaired. As the Water Spray Fire\r\n System protects safety-related equipment from fire, the reactors were\r\n shut down to maintain nuclear safety. The Nuclear Installations\r\n Inspectorate (NII) Site Inspector&#39;s initial investigation raised\r\n a number of concerns with respect to the adequacy of the Water Spray\r\n Fire System. A Direction to review and reassess safety was issued\r\n under Licence Condition 15(4). The results of this were reported to\r\n NII by the end of March 2002 as required. BEGL has already made some\r\n improvements to the system and the Site Inspector is continuing with\r\n his investigations.</p>",50.91333,0.95985
HEYSHAM 1 - British Energy Generation Limited (BEGL),,11/03/02,Q1 02,2002,2,"<p>British Energy reported an event at Heysham 1 on 11 March\r\n involving a fuelling machine operation at a Fuel Storage Tube. The\r\n machine had collected a new fuel assembly from the tube and had\r\n replaced this with a short shield plug. Unknown to the operators, and\r\n contrary to the indications at the fuelling machine, the shield plug\r\n had not disconnected from the machine grab. A mechanical interlock\r\n designed to prevent the machine moving until safe to do so had\r\n failed. This allowed the machine to move sideways which resulted in\r\n impact between the shield plug and the storage tube. The shield plug\r\n was severed into two parts with the lower part falling into the\r\n storage tube.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The NII Site Inspector visited the site within a few hours of the\r\n event being reported. He confirmed that the nuclear safety\r\n significance of the actual event was low, but that it could have been\r\n more serious if the fuelling machine had been operating at the\r\n reactor. There are, however, other interlocks to provide protection\r\n in this case. He also confirmed that a full investigation was\r\n underway and that the refuelling safety case would be revalidated\r\n before the machine was used again over the reactor. The event was\r\n subsequently categorised as a level 2 event (an incident) on the\r\n internationally used INES scale of nuclear events, due to the\r\n implications of multiple failures of safety provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>NII has closely scrutinised the licensee&#39;s investigation and\r\n safety case revalidation process.

Torness - British Energy (BE),,N/A,Q3 02,2002,N/A,"<p>The sudden and extensive failure of a gas circulator at Torness in\r\n May 2002 was thought, from forensic evidence, to be linked to the\r\n development of an unexpected fatigue related crack in part of the\r\n impeller. In August, another gas circulator on the other Torness\r\n reactor showed signs of increasing vibration and was promptly shut\r\n down by the operators. Its subsequent disassembly revealed a fully\r\n developed fatigue related crack in a similar position to the first\r\n failure, but the prompt shutdown had prevented consequential\r\n damage.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Following the initial failure, British Energy (BE) increased the\r\n attention given to circulator vibration monitoring. As a result of\r\n the second failure, more extensive routine monitoring of circulator\r\n characteristics is being undertaken and more extensive circulator\r\n monitoring equipment is being fitted to allow efficient, cross-fleet\r\n monitoring of circulator behaviour. Activities in this area are being\r\n brought up to best practice standards.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Inspectors from HSE&#39;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII)\r\n monitored the recovery of the first failed circulator and its\r\n examination by BE specialists, and BE&#39;s examination of the fixed\r\n structure for any signs of damage. Agreement to replace the failed\r\n generator was given by HSE when it was satisfied that there was no\r\n structural damage to the reactor. As the second failure did not\r\n result in the disintegration of the circulator impeller there was no\r\n damage to the reactor structure.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>With the discovery of a systematic and comparatively frequent\r\n failure mechanism, safety concerns increased and NII required a\r\n revised and extended safety case to cover operations. This\r\n incorporated forewarning of failure by early and effective detection\r\n of changes in vibration patterns together with recognition of the\r\n need to shut down any affected circulators before major failure and\r\n consequential challenge to the circulator casing occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>BE has inspected all gas circulator impellers in service at\r\n Torness and found no evidence of developing defects. Only a limited\r\n number of impellers have been inspected at Heysham 2, but again no\r\n defects have been found. BE has provided acceptable interim safety\r\n cases justifying continued operation of the reactors at Torness and\r\n at its sister station Heysham 2, and will produce, in the spring of\r\n 2003, final safety cases incorporating all the findings from its\r\n inquiry into the failures and changes introduced in the light of the\r\n events at Torness.</p>",55.96825,-2.40659
