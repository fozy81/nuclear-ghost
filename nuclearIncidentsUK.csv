SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),Sellafield,08/10/00,,Q4 00,2000,1,1," <p>A loss of electrical supplies to a large portion of the Sellafield site was experienced during Monday 9th October 2000. The failure centred on faults experienced on a new section of 11kV switchgear. Supplies were re-established within 47 minutes of the loss, well within the two hours allowed for in the safety case.</p> <p>The actions of BNFL during the recovery phase from the incident were found to be generally commendable, ensuring reinstatement of electrical supplies to the affected area well within the time allowed in the safety case.</p> <p>An NII team carried out an initial investigation into the incident. It concluded that the direct cause was a defective component in new electrical switchgear being installed as part of a project to update the electrical infrastructure on the site. The work was being carried out by Norweb, as contractors to BNFL, to arrangements that were regarded as standard practice for this sort of work.</p> <p>BNFL also carried out an investigation, which came to similar conclusions. This report is still formally awaited by NII, although there has been sufficient progress in satisfying NII&#39;s safety concerns with respect to the electrical infrastructure at Sellafield.</p> <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES). </p>",54.4193,-3.4874,F
HUNTERSTON B (British Energy Generation (UK) plc),Hunterston,N/A,,Q1 01,2001,1,1,"<p>During routine monitoring of Hunterston B, it was discovered that there was radioactivity in the ground water in the bore holes associated with reactor 4. This event was reported under the site arrangements, initially to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), and later to other government departments.</p> <p>The licensee continues to investigate this matter with the assistance of company specialists and external contractors. The findings so far suggest that the levels of radioactivity present in the ground water are low and are decreasing. The source of the activity has not yet been conclusively identified, and this continues to be investigated by the licensee. Indications are that it was a one-off rather than continuous or recurring event.</p> <p>So far there are no detectable off-site effects, and steps are being taken to remove the arisings as they build up in the bore holes. Currently the evidence suggests that this event is not of radiological significance for workers and the public.</p> <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). The NII and SEPA are being kept informed of developments in this matter.</p>",55.72269,-4.88997,F
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),Sellafield,06/03/01,,Q1 01,2001,1,1,"<p>On 6 March 2001, during a routine glove change operation on a glovebox in the plutonium processing section of the B205 Magnox reprocessing plant at Sellafield, plutonium contamination was released into the working area.</p> <p>This occurred when a seal weld on a waste export bag failed, releasing contaminated waste items onto the floor. Two workers were exposed to elevated levels of airborne plutonium, and BNFL&#39;s early estimate is that they have each received an effective internal exposure of about 4 mSv.</p> <p>BNFL&#39;s best estimate of the amount of radioactive material spilled is 24 Mbq of plutonium-239 and 720 Mbq of plutonium-241. This is 24 times the reporting level specified in IRR99 for plutonium-239 and seven times that specified for plutonium-241. BNFL has recovered the spilled material and decontaminated the working area. There was no release of radioactivity to the environment following the event or during the clean up activities.</p> <p>HSE investigated the event and required BNFL to undertake a site wide review of similar operations. This confirmed that there was a wide variation in the methods used for work within plutonium gloveboxes on the site. BNFL has developed an action plan to prevent a recurrence in B205. In addition, BNFL is reviewing its methods for carrying out plutonium glovebox operations.</p> <p>HSE is considering taking formal regulatory action. The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).</p>",54.4193,-3.4874,F
CHAPELCROSS (British Nuclear Fuels plc),Chapelcross,N/A,,Q1 01,2001,1,1,"<p>During refuelling operations on Reactor 2, an irradiated fuel element failed to release from the grab (this is used to hold an element while it is withdrawn from a reactor). Routine methods were used to release the grab. However, the irradiated fuel element snagged during the operation and was lifted out of its shielding resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the intense radiation being emitted from the irradiated fuel element. Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose received by them was small.</p> <p>The event revealed shortfalls in the safety of the refuelling operation and the licensee took the immediate step of halting all refuelling operations while it investigated the event and reviewed the safety of the equipment. The NII investigated the event and judged that it was due to inadequate design and operation of the equipment. The licensee has modified the equipment and procedures in accordance with the nuclear site licence requirements and NII has agreed to fuelling operations continuing.</p> <p>The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br /> </p>",55.0176,-3.224,F
HEYSHAM 1 (British Energy Generation Limited),Heysham,N/A,,Q3 01,2001,1,1,"<p>To meet the requirements of the nuclear site licence, each of the two reactors at Heysham 1 is shutdown periodically to enable examination, inspection, maintenance or testing of safety related components that cannot be accessed when the reactor is operating. Reactor 1 was subject to a periodic shutdown in August/September 2001.</p> <p>Inspections of the reactor graphite core are carried out using remote TV cameras and equipment to measure the geometry of the core components. The aim of the inspections is to confirm that the core components are performing in accordance with the predictions assumed in the safety case. During the planned inspections of the Reactor 1 core fuel channels, BEGL found cracks in some of the graphite bricks. The cracking of reactor core bricks is a known and predicted ageing condition for irradiated graphite and has been observed at other AGR stations. BEGL responded to the inspection findings in a conservative way by revisiting and updating their existing core safety case for Heysham 1. Consideration was also given to the possible implications of the inspection findings to the other operating AGRs . The BEGL review considered the inspection results against the assumptions made in the existing safety case, which included the possibility of cracks in the core bricks, and concluded that the revised core safety case was valid for a further period of operation.</p> <p>Specialist graphite inspectors from the HSE&#39;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate carried out a detailed assessment of the revised core safety case, to ensure that the required safety functionality of the reactor core would be maintained for a further period of operation. NII&#39;s assessment focussed on ensuring sufficient safety margins were available in the safety case to allow for any further cracking of the core bricks. The NII assessment concluded that the safety case was adequate to support the return to service of Heysham 1 Reactor 1 and that the safety cases for other AGR stations remained valid.</p> <p>The event was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES).</p>",54.02924,-2.91493,F
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),Sellafield,06/07/01,,Q3 01,2001,1,1,"<p>During a rainstorm on 6 July 2001, localised flooding about 10-15 centimetres deep occurred outside a laboratory complex and overflowed an external door threshold into the building. The water entered an old laboratory which is currently being decommissioned. Historic plutonium (Pu) contamination, probably from under a floor lining, was re-suspended by the flooding and spread over part of the laboratory floor. The area has subsequently been cleaned up and decontaminated. There was no release of radioactivity from the building and no radiation dose received by the workforce.</p> <p>BNFL reported the incident as a spill under the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRR99). The estimated amount of activity involved was equivalent to 10MBq of 239Pu and 200MBq of 241Pu which is respectively 10 and two times the IRR reporting level. The incident was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).</p> <p>BNFL carried out remedial work on the building to prevent a reoccurrence of the water ingress, and additional work is in hand to strengthen these measures. HSE&#39;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate investigated the incident, and is monitoring progress with the remedial work.</p>",54.4193,-3.4874,F
CHAPELCROSS (British Nuclear Fuels plc),Chapelcross,05/07/01,,Q3 01,2001,1,1,"<p>At 1.20 am on 5 July, during routine discharge operations on Reactor 3 at BNFL&#39;s Chapelcross nuclear power station, a basket containing 24 irradiated magnox fuel elements dropped. It fell about 5 feet onto a door in the pile cap floor, but was still contained within the discharge machine. BNFL stood down its Emergency Control Centre at about 6pm when it concluded that the fuel was stable and that no radioactivity had been released.</p> <p>On the eveni<!-- #BeginDate format:IS1 -->2011-10-26<!-- #EndDate --> detailed remote TV examination, and found that 12 fuel elements were missing from the basket. After further checks, BNFL concluded that the door the basket had been resting upon must have been opened during discharge operations, and that the missing elements must have fallen about 80 feet, down the discharge shaft through which the elements are normally lowered in the baskets.</p> <p>BNFL declared a site incident on 12 July in order to be better able to co-ordinate its activities. The NII set up its Response Centre and dispatched a team of inspectors to the site. NII focused upon ensuring that BNFL took appropriate steps to locate and recover the missing fuel. They recovered it safely on 17 July, and the NII was able to stand down its Response Centre as it was satisfied that no member of the public or employees had incurred any harm from the incident.</p> <p>Subsequently, priority was given to regulating BNFL&#39;s recovery of the 12 irradiated fuel elements still within the discharge machine. This was achieved safely on 27 October.</p> <p>BNFL has embargoed routine refuelling operations at Chapelcross, and will have to provide a safety case to satisfy the NII that it can return to routine refuelling safely. Similar measures have been taken at its sister station at Calder Hall.</p> <p>The NII is producing a report, which will be available to the public on this incident which was classified as Level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br /> </p>",55.0176,-3.224,F
SELLAFIELD (British Nuclear Fuels plc),Sellafield,N/A,,Q4 01,2001,0,0,"<p>British Nuclear Fuels reported the detection of Tc<sup>99</sup> in groundwater taken from a borehole on its Sellafield site close to the Main Gate. This was the result for the first analysis of groundwater from this borehole for this isotope. The incident report noted that the sample may have been a false analysis. Subsequent analyses have confirmed Tc<sup>99</sup> in this borehole and, at lesser concentration, in others in the same area. Activity has also been detected beyond the site boundary but at much lower concentrations.</p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive&#39;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) has asked BNFL to determine the source of the activity and to report the work the company is undertaking to prevent further leakage from the plant and to prevent activity leaving the site.</p> <p>The company has confirmed that the probable source of activity in the ground is the sludge storage tanks in Building B241. These old tanks have been suspected to be leaking for some years and recent modifications have been made to address this. The recent detection appears to be confirmation that leaked material has reached the groundwater on the site. The fall off of activity concentration in boreholes away from the plant is consistent with B241 being the source of the activity.</p> <p>To remove the potential for leakage from this old facility, BNFL is proposing to commence emptying the storage tanks in 2002. The NII is currently considering the safety case for BNFL&#39;s plans to do this. The Inspectorate has requested BNFL&#39;s proposals for control of the radioactive material that has entered the ground and expects to receive this soon.</p> <p>In respect of the activity detected off the site, the Environment Agency has stated that it is satisfied that the reported concentration of Tc<sup>99</sup> is radiologically insignificant. However, until the source of the activity is known, the Agency has regulatory concern. It also has requested BNFL to undertake monitoring to confirm the point of leakage, and will work with NII to consider any regulatory action.</p> <p>The incident has been classified as Level 0 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).<br /> </p>",54.4193,-3.4874,F
Dungeness B - British Energy Generation Limited (BEGL),Dungeness,N/A,01/01/02,Q1 02,2002,N/A,0,"<p>In January 2002 BEGL reported two events that had each led to water leaks from joints in large diameter pipes of the Dungeness B Water Spray Fire System. In both cases, the system was removed from service to enable the leaks to be repaired. As the Water Spray Fire System protects safety-related equipment from fire, the reactors were shut down to maintain nuclear safety. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) Site Inspector&#39;s initial investigation raised a number of concerns with respect to the adequacy of the Water Spray Fire System. A Direction to review and reassess safety was issued under Licence Condition 15(4). The results of this were reported to NII by the end of March 2002 as required. BEGL has already made some improvements to the system and the Site Inspector is continuing with his investigations.</p>",50.91333,0.95985,F
HEYSHAM 1 - British Energy Generation Limited (BEGL),Heysham,11/03/02,,Q1 02,2002,2,2,"<p>British Energy reported an event at Heysham 1 on 11 March involving a fuelling machine operation at a Fuel Storage Tube. The machine had collected a new fuel assembly from the tube and had replaced this with a short shield plug. Unknown to the operators, and contrary to the indications at the fuelling machine, the shield plug had not disconnected from the machine grab. A mechanical interlock designed to prevent the machine moving until safe to do so had failed. This allowed the machine to move sideways which resulted in impact between the shield plug and the storage tube. The shield plug was severed into two parts with the lower part falling into the storage tube.</p> <p>The NII Site Inspector visited the site within a few hours of the event being reported. He confirmed that the nuclear safety significance of the actual event was low, but that it could have been more serious if the fuelling machine had been operating at the reactor. There are, however, other interlocks to provide protection in this case. He also confirmed that a full investigation was underway and that the refuelling safety case would be revalidated before the machine was used again over the reactor. The event was subsequently categorised as a level 2 event (an incident) on the internationally used INES scale of nuclear events, due to the implications of multiple failures of safety provisions.</p> <p>NII has closely scrutinised the licensee&#39;s investigation and safety case revalidation process. We also used our regulatory powers to prevent the refuelling machine being returned to service without our agreement. We eventually allowed BE to return the machine to service following our assessment of the revalidated safety case. We continue to monitor the longer term actions arising from the event as part of our routine regulatory business.<br /> </p>",54.02924,-2.91493,F
Torness - British Energy (BE),Torness,N/A,01/05/02,Q3 02,2002,N/A,0,"<p>The sudden and extensive failure of a gas circulator at Torness in May 2002 was thought, from forensic evidence, to be linked to the development of an unexpected fatigue related crack in part of the impeller. In August, another gas circulator on the other Torness reactor showed signs of increasing vibration and was promptly shut down by the operators. Its subsequent disassembly revealed a fully developed fatigue related crack in a similar position to the first failure, but the prompt shutdown had prevented consequential damage.</p> <p>Following the initial failure, British Energy (BE) increased the attention given to circulator vibration monitoring. As a result of the second failure, more extensive routine monitoring of circulator characteristics is being undertaken and more extensive circulator monitoring equipment is being fitted to allow efficient, cross-fleet monitoring of circulator behaviour. Activities in this area are being brought up to best practice standards.</p> <p>Inspectors from HSE&#39;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) monitored the recovery of the first failed circulator and its examination by BE specialists, and BE&#39;s examination of the fixed structure for any signs of damage. Agreement to replace the failed generator was given by HSE when it was satisfied that there was no structural damage to the reactor. As the second failure did not result in the disintegration of the circulator impeller there was no damage to the reactor structure.</p> <p>With the discovery of a systematic and comparatively frequent failure mechanism, safety concerns increased and NII required a revised and extended safety case to cover operations. This incorporated forewarning of failure by early and effective detection of changes in vibration patterns together with recognition of the need to shut down any affected circulators before major failure and consequential challenge to the circulator casing occurs.</p> <p>BE has inspected all gas circulator impellers in service at Torness and found no evidence of developing defects. Only a limited number of impellers have been inspected at Heysham 2, but again no defects have been found. BE has provided acceptable interim safety cases justifying continued operation of the reactors at Torness and at its sister station Heysham 2, and will produce, in the spring of 2003, final safety cases incorporating all the findings from its inquiry into the failures and changes introduced in the light of the events at Torness.</p>",55.96825,-2.40659,F
Harwell (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority),Harwell,06/11/02,,Q4 02,2002,N/A,0,"<p>On 6 November 2002 during operations in a glove box in B220, the over pressure alarm sounded. The operators evacuated and shortly afterwards the airborne activity monitors also sounded. The building emergency arrangements for airborne activity alarms was initiated to ascertain the source and to manage the operations. An investigation by UKAEA confirmed that a release of Americium 241 into the working area had occurred at a quantity in excess of Schedule 8 column 4 of the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRRs). A number of personnel have received intakes including the two operators and the health physics personnel who attended the event. The highest dose (up to 6 mSv.) was received by the Health Physics charge hand.</p> <p>UKAEA placed an embargo on the use of similar systems and have completed their own management investigation and produced an internal report. It concludes that the likely cause of the event was over-pressurisation of the vacuum equipment used in the process. The report also highlights improvements required to the ventilation system in the laboratory and adjoining areas. An action plan has been developed for this work and progress is being made.</p> <p>NII has followed the UKAEA investigation and carried out its own study including a visit by a ventilation specialist. This has confirmed the problems with the ventilation system. It is a complex issue that may have a wider impact across the building. A letter has been sent to UKAEA detailing a series of short-term requirements and the need to review implications and produce a longer-term action plan. UKAEA is cooperating fully with these requirements.</p>",51.5752,-1.32245,F
Dounreay (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority),Dounreay,12/11/02,,Q4 02,2002,0,0,"<p>On 12 November 2002, two contractors leaving the D2001 Intermediate Level Waste Processing facility were found to have contaminated shoes and one had contamination on his hands. All personnel in the building were withdrawn and monitored, and as a result contamination was revealed on the shoes of a further fifteen individuals. Of these, one other person had contamination on his hands and face. The two individuals with personal contamination were sent to the Occupational Health Department where decontamination was successfully carried out the following day.</p> <p>In parallel with UKAEA&#39;s investigation, an investigation into the incident was carried out by NII commencing at site on 13 November 2002. The investigation concluded that the source of the contamination was the leakage of a small quantity of contaminated Zinc Bromide liquid from a flask. This had been swabbed up from the inside of a shielded waste cell and placed in a waste container which was then posted out of the cell into the flask for processing and consignment for storage. The flask, waste container and the associated bagging system is not designed to provide containment of free liquids and the Zinc Bromide leaked to the outside of the flask and was spread around the working area on the shoes of the workers.<br /> <br /> The actual doses received by the individuals affected by the incident were confirmed to be very low. In addition, checks of the discharge stack monitors concluded that there was no evidence of a release to the environment.<br /> <br /> NII&#39;s investigation report revealed a number of shortcomings which are being addressed by UKAEA. An Improvement Notice was served under the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999 (IRRs) requiring improvements to be made to the flasking system design and operations.</p> <p>The incident has been classified as Level 0 on the International Nuclear Event Scale.</p>",58.57956,-3.74345,F
Hartlepool (British Energy),Hartlepool,09/06/04,,Q2 04,2004,N/A,0,"<p> On 9 June 2004 a flange leaked within the equipment used to handle tritrated water (i.e. water in which some of the hydrogen atoms are in the form of the radioactive isotope tritium) in the radioactive effluent treatment plant (RAETP) at Hartlepool power station. Approximately 900 litres of liquor were released. The station declared a site incident, which was stood down on 13 June after the affected areas had been restored to normal access conditions . During this time access to the affected area was controlled by the station to prevent unauthorised access to the contaminated areas and thus ensure that doses to workers were properly controlled. </p> <p> The leak was retained within the bunded RAETP and discharged through authorized discharge routes, except for a small quantity, which escaped through evaporation. Assements by both station and the Environment Agency demonstrated that: a) doses to workers were only a small percentage of the annual limits; and b) the off-site dose was insignificant. </p> <p> British Energy immediately set up a Divisional Panel of Inquiry and the details of the event and the lessons learned were promulgated to all sites. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Environment Agency have conducted a joint investigation. The EA has advised station that it does not intend to prosecute. The NII is due to report shortly but is also expected to advise station that it will not prosecute. </p>",54.635,-1.1808,F
Bradwell (Magnox Electric),Bradwell,14/04/04,,Q2 04,2004,N/A,0,<p> On 14 April 2004 there was a release of radioactivity in the reactor building at Bradwell Power station operated by Magnox Electric plc. </p> <p> The incident occurred while preparations were being made to lower a camera into the reactor which was to be used to observe some modified equipment for defuelling. The operation involved opening a set of valves and the wrong valve was opened which lead to the release because unexpectedly the reactor was under pressure. The contamination alarm sounded but there was some delay before the area was evacuated. </p> <p> 6 members of staff received small doses of radiation below legal limits. The incident is still under investigation by NII. </p>,51.74175,0.89754,F
Sellafield (British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited),Sellafield,13/02/05,,Q1 05,2005,N/A,0,"<p> On 13 February 2005, three staff were contaminated whilst changing a thermocouple on Thorp Head End Dissolver vessel C. The risk assessment for the work did not anticipate a breach of containment, as the design intent was for the thermocouple separated from the dissolved nuclear fuel by being located inside a sealed tube called a 'thermowell'. This intent was not achieved. After initial incident, whilst seeking reassurance monitoring, the workers spread contamination to various plant areas and were then taken to site surgery for decontamination. The workers were contaminated on the face and hands and decontamination of the hands continued over several days. BNGSL have advised NII that no statutory dose limits were exceeded, although one worker received an extremity dose greater than 10% of the annual statutory limit. </p> <p> On the day of the event, the Thorp Incident Control Centre was set up and plant access restricted until decontamination was complete. Investigations indicated that there was a slight leak in the Dissolver C thermowell, which appears to have allowed contamination in-seepage. Following completion of the BNGSL investigation, a second barrier was engineered around the thermowell pocket and the dissolver was returned to normal operations. </p> <p> BNGSLâ\u0080\u0099s analysis of the amount of contamination on the thermocouple and the smaller amount contaminating the people and spread on plant, indicated a spillage which exceeded Ministerial reporting criteria by virtue of the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999, Schedule 8, column 4. BNGSL advised NII that they were reporting this event under these criteria. </p>",54.4193,-3.4874,F
Sellafield (British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited),Sellafield,01/04/05,,Q2 05,2005,3,3,"<p>  On the 20 th April 2005 British Nuclear Group Sellafield Ltd, (BNGSL), the licensee, discovered a leak which had occurred within the Thorp Head End Feed Clarification Cell. The leak was from pipe-work to a vessel designated an Accountancy Tank that held dissolved fuel in nitric acid solution while accountancy calculations were made. The leak was estimated at 83 cubic metres. HSE/NII was informed of the leak later the same day. </p> <p> The relevant plant and operations including fuel shearing were promptly shut down by BNGSL. Some down-stream parts of the plant were subsequently restarted, after discussion with NII, in order to drain other tanks in the same cell which had liquor held within them when the plant was shut down. </p> <p> The leak was into a stainless steel clad, heavily shielded cell designed to contain such leaks, and there has been no indication that any liquid leaked from the cell. Plant radiation monitoring showed that there was neither abnormal radioactivity in air nor radioactivity released to the environment as a result of this event. BNGSL has concluded that no workers or members of the public have been affected. </p> <p> Camera inspections within the cell showed that other pipe work and vessels within the cell showed no sign of leakage. BNGSL criticality assessors concluded that a criticality was not possible based on the properties of the leaked liquor. </p> <p> On notification of the event, NII set up an internal review group to consider the adequacy of the actions taken to recover the situation. NII was kept fully informed of recovery plans and monitored the situation closely to ensure that safety remained assured. The cell has built-in equipment for the recovery of any leaked liquor back into primary containment tanks and all the leaked liquid has now been recovered this way. NII is satisfied that the plant remains in a safe state and that there have been no harmful effects to people or the environment. Liaison was maintained throughout with the Environment Agency. </p> <p> BNGSL evaluated this event as INES category 3, because of the significant release of radioactivity into the secondary containment. </p> <p> Subsequent to the completion of the â\u0080\u0098make safeâ\u0080\u0099 operations, an NII team commenced an investigation at the site on 16 th May 2005. The preliminary findings led NII to issue two Improvement Notices on 17 th June 2005 to ensure that BNGSL promptly rectified deficiencies in compliance with nuclear site licence conditions relating to the operation of the THORP Feed Clarification Cell. The Improvement Notices compel BNGSL to improve compliance in the areas of leak detection, operating instructions, record keeping and maintenance and testing of safety related equipment. The NII investigation is continuing, but it is too soon to say whether this will result in further regulatory action. </p> <p> In the meantime, BNGSL is considering options for the restart of the plant and has liaised with regulators on its initial ideas, but a firm proposal has not yet been submitted. </p>",54.4193,-3.4874,F
Sellafield (British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited),Sellafield,04/12/05,,Q4 05,2005,N/A,0,"<p> On 4 December 2005, British Nuclear Group Sellafield Ltd, (BNGSL), the licensee, detected high levels of radiation in some outcell areas of the Highly Active Liquor Evaporation and Storage (HALES) facility. This occurred during a routine operation to sample highly active liquor. </p> <p> The operation was stopped. Operators evacuated the building safely and quickly in accordance with instructions. Controlled reâ\u0080\u0091entries into the building were then carried out to define the scope of the problem and put in place appropriate contingency controls and recovery plans. </p> <p> There was no loss of primary containment and no environmental effects were found inside or external to the building. Restrictions were placed on the use of an adjacent building because of high background radiation levels but were later removed on successful completion of the recovery plans. </p> <p> Three operators carried out the sampling operation. They received radiation doses, which were elevated though well within legal limits. </p> <p> The source of the high radiation was traced to a small diameter wash line feeding the sampling plant. The line has since been cleared, restoring normal operating conditions except to local areas where some access restrictions remain. </p> <p> HSEâ\u0080\u0099s NII has conducted a preliminary investigation and BNGSL is conducting its own internal investigation. The root cause of the incident has not yet been established but on the basis of its own investigation, BNGSL has already recognised the need to improve its approach to learning from experience in HALES. NII will await completion of BNGSL's investigation before deciding whether enforcement action is warranted. </p> <p> NIl will seek engineered improvements to ensure the safety of future sampling operations. </p>",54.4193,-3.4874,F

This is a part of the site where historic contamination is known to be  present. A contamination smear sample  from inside the manhole showed the presence of about 1.3kBq of alpha emitting radioactive material which was subsequently found to contain 60% plutonium/americium. The manhole was  sealed and the area designated as â\u0080\u0098radioactive contamination highâ\u0080\u0099. The quantity of plutonium on the smear sample was about 1000 times less than that of Column 4 of Schedule 8 of Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999.</p>    <p>As part of their investigation UKAEA placed a temporary enclosure over the manhole to provide an additional means of containing any plutonium present and to facilitate control over personnel entries to perform further radiological surveys. Surveys of the inside of the manhole were performed on 3rd July 2007, through the temporary enclosure by UKAEA  personnel wearing air fed suits. No further alpha contamination was found inside the manhole. UKAEAâ\u0080\u0098s investigation is still ongoing, but  is expected to conclude that there is no significant contamination inside the manhole, however the source of the plutonium contamination from the smear sample remains unknown.</p>    <p>The alpha contamination found on 20th June 2007 on a filter processing water  from a spring just outside the site boundary, but close to the contaminated manhole was investigated in depth.

A  quantity of this water was discharged to ground because of a pre-existing  rupture to an underground pipeline. No  one was injured as a result of the incident and the cooling water was not  radioactive.</p> <p>   HSE  launched two separate but linked investigations to consider the reasons why  cooling water flow was lost and the pipeline was ruptured.

Dungeness B,Dungeness,N/A,01/03/03,Q4 12,2012,1,1,"<p> On  5 November 2012, EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Ltd (NGL) found that an  incorrect control rod had been loaded into Reactor 22 at Dungeness B in March  2003. The misload was identified during routine control rod maintenance after  their removal from the reactor.</p><p> There  are a total of 57 control rods of two different types in each reactor at  Dungeness&nbsp;B: 36 more absorbing black rods and 21 less absorbing grey  rods.Â  The issue related to a grey rod  being loaded where a black rod should have been.Â </p><p> At  the time this misload was identified, Reactor 21 was in a shutdown state on a  planned refuelling outage whilst Reactor 22 was operating.Â  NGL produced a justification for continued  operation of Reactor 22 until its next planned refuelling outage in January 2013.  NGL also placed embargoes on refuelling and subsequent re-start of  Reactor&nbsp;21 due to the possibility of such a loading fault on that reactor  too.Â  These embargoes were lifted  progressively as additional information became available, culminating in a justification  for the re-start of Reactor 21.Â  ONR was satisfied  by NGLâ\u0080\u0099s decision-making process throughout.</p><p> To support the safety justification for the re-start  of Reactor 21, NGL produced evidence of control rod inventory and maintenance  and movement documentation.Â  ONR  inspectors are content with the conclusions of these review reports. </p><p> ONR  considers NGLâ\u0080\u0099s investigation and corrective action plan to be adequate,  subject to extension of a planned human factors assessment to cover the process  for generation and control of records for both reactors.Â  NGL is taking this ONR recommendation through  its due process and has indicated its intent to progress it.</p><p> NGL  has established that this incident was caused by a procedural failure prior to  the misloading incident in 2003.</p><p> Due  to the age of the incident, the improvements made by NGL and the corrective  actions identified, ONR is not planning further investigation but will continue  to discuss with NGL potential improvements to safety cases dealing with control  rod misload.</p><p> This  incident has been rated at Level 1 on INES, which is an anomaly on the 7 level  scale.</p>",50.91333,0.95985,F
Dungeness  B,Dungeness,N/A,01/05/13,Q2 13,2013,1,1,"<p>In its <a href=""http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/quarterly-stat/2012-4.htm"">statement of nuclear  incidents at nuclear installations</a> for the fourth quarter of 2012, ONR  reported that EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Ltd (NGL) had notified the  regulator that the primary sea defence at the Dungeness B power station (a  shingle bank) was not as robust as previously thought.Â  This incident arose from work commissioned by  NGL in response to recommendation 10 in the <a href=\""http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/fukushima/interim-report.pdf\"">interim  Weightman report</a> into the implications for the UK  from Fukushima, which required the UK nuclear  industry to review external flooding studies.Â   For Dungeness B, this review indicated higher â\u0080\u0098over toppingâ\u0080\u0099 rates for  the primary sea defence than previously thought - this is the rate at which sea  water comes over the top of the primary sea defence.</p>  <p>Following this  incident in December 2012, NGL installed local flood protection around key  safety related equipment.Â Â  Improvements  were also made to operating procedures and further extensive modelling and  physical testing was commissioned to obtain more certainty in the predicted sea  water levels on site during 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 year events.</p>  <p>This programme  of modelling and physical testing was completed in May 2013.Â  The results confirmed that the over topping  rates in use since the December 2012 incident were conservative.Â  However, the results also indicated that  â\u0080\u0098outflankingâ\u0080\u0099 of the primary sea defence could be a significant contributor to  sea water levels on the site - this is where sea flooding to the sides of the  primary sea defence in front of the site leads to water on the site.Â  The new work indicated that the local flood  protection work already completed needed to be extended and improved to further  enhance the protection against sea flooding hazards.</p>  <p>Having reviewed  all aspects of the new hazard predictions, NGL decided to shut down Reactor 22  whilst a programme of improvements to plant, procedures and training was </p>  <p>implemented.Â  Reactor 22 was shut down on 20 May 2013.Â  At that time the other reactor on the site,  Reactor 21, was already shut down on a planned refuelling outage.Â  NGL decided to prepare a sea flooding safety  case at Category 1 (the highest safety significance category and hence  employing the most robust NGL approval process) to support the return to  service.</p>  <p> A  multi-disciplinary team of ONR specialist inspectors, together with the ONR  site inspector and an ONR project inspector monitored the evolution of NGLâ\u0080\u0099s  return to service safety case so that ONR was satisfied that:</p>  <ol class=\""a\"">    <li>An  adequate safety case was prepared in terms of plant, procedures and training at  return to service.</li>    <li>An  adequate forward programme of post return to service improvements is in place  to ensure that safety continues to improve until a final long term position is  reached.</li>  </ol>  <p>Reactor 22  returned to service under the sea flooding return to service safety case on 14  July 2013 and Reactor 21 will return to service several days after this.</p>  <p>ONR will  continue to monitor post return to service sea flooding improvements until the  sea flooding design basis for Dungeness B has been fully restored (protection  against the 1 in 10,000 year sea flooding event with a margin against more  severe but less likely sea flooding).Â   This will happen when a protective wall has been built around the site,  the safety benefit from which is claimed in a final long term sea flooding  safety case.</p>  <p>NGL has  committed to have the protective wall in place by the end of 2013.</p>  <p>The  incident originally reported in December 2012 was rated by NGL at Level 1 on  INES, which is an anomaly on the 7 level scale  </p>",50.91333,0.95985,T
